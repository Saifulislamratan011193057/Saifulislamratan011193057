But I can clearly remember the memories of the day. When I first went to school, I was six years old. My mother proposed me that I needed to admit in the school one day. She said to me that I would go to school to admit the next day. I was excited to hear the amazing news. The news of my going to school was thrilling to me because for many days I was thinking about my new school, teachers and classmates. I excited because my dream is going to true. Truly speaking, I could not sleep well even a single moment at night because the next morning will be my first day of school life. My mother woke me early in the morning. She washed me very well, combed my hair and dressed in new clothes.</p>
        <p align="left"style="color:black;">Then I had breakfast and started for the school with her. The school was not very far from our home. Therefore, we walk there on foot. It took us half hour to reach the school. When I stepped inside the school compound I was amazed to see the many children. They running here and there, playing; talking to each other, gesturing etc. Some boys and girls were my same age. I felt happy finding some same age children. I went to the school with my mother. It was really a thrilling experience for me. I was very excited to discover the new something. I was eagerly waiting for the day when I was gone to admit the school. At last, the expected days came to the door. It added a new dimension in my life.</p>
        <p align="left"style="color:blue;">However, at first, I was taken to the Headmasters room. The headmaster was very friendly and gentle man. I liked him very much. His smiling face amused me very much. He asked me some question and I answered the entire questions correctly. He was pleased to me. Then he called a teacher to take to me in class. I entered the class first. For the first time I saw my classroom, classmates and teachers. I became familiar with my classmates and teachers. They receive me cordially. In the end, the going to my first day at school is my most memorable days in my life. It is a sum of sweets memory. It will be ever fresh in my mind. It is a part of my life. I never forget the day.</p>
